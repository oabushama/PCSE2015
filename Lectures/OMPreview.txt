==== Concepts

process / thread / thread team

threads / cores / tasks

directives / library functions / environment variables

==== Parallel regions

execution by a team

==== Work sharing

loop / sections / single / workshare

implied barrier

loop scheduling, reduction

sections

single vs master

(F) workshare

==== Data scope

shared vs private, C vs F

loop variables and reduction variables

default declaration

firstprivate, lastprivate

==== Synchronization

barriers, implied & explicit

nowait

critical sections

locks, difference with critical

==== Tasks

generation vs execution

dependencies
